# chat_app

Fully Functioning Chat Application With Flutter and Firebase

## In this app-

- Firstly you have to send a chat request to someone with whom you want to start a conversation. If that person accepts the request he/she will be added into your contacts and you can start a conversation.
- You can delete the sent request, received request, contact and a message, and for that you just need to horizontally swipe over it.
- Your google account's photo will be used if you sign in with google.
- You can get the read receipts. If the message is sent and not seen by another person then all corners of the message will be rounded and if another person reads the message then the bottom right corner will not look rounded anymore.
- One thing I forgot to include in the video is you can see at what time a message is sent by clicking on that message.
- Username is unique so you can't use a username which is used by someone else.
- You can reset the password if you forget.
